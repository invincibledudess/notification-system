## Prerequisites
Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine:

* Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/download/) and the npm package manager. If you encounter any problems, you can also use this [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814) to install Node.js.
* MongoDB - [Download & Install MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads), and make sure it's running on the default port (27017).

### Getting the database
Since the MongoDB will already be installed by now:

* start mongo: open cmd, type **mongod**, you will need to create "data/db" folders in your current drive (e.g. Windows C: Drive, create C:\Data\db).
* I have also attached the already created database. You can use the same database.

### Compiling Your Application

The first thing you should do is install the Node.js dependencies. The application comes pre-bundled with a package.json file that contains the list of modules you need to start your application.

To install Node.js dependencies you're going to use npm again. In the application folder run this in the command-line:

```bash
$ npm install
```

### Running Your Application

* On Command Prompt inside your project home folder, write:

```bash
$ node server.js
```

Your application should run on port 3000, so in your browser just go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

That's it! Your application should be running by now.
