Database Design:

According to the Application, it needs the following collections in all:
	1. Characters :  The collection keeps the records of all the characters in the Gossip Girl series.
	2. Subscriptions : The collection keeps the records of the subscription type for the users who will be taking the subscription. The subscription 	includes, only whereabouts, only precaps, all, etc.
	3. Activities : It is a capped collection which keeps track of the activities of the Gossip girl characters. The schema also includes the type of activity and the character who did it.
	4. Users : The collection keeps the records of the users who are subscribed to the Gossip Girls characters.
	
Application Flow:

The application starts with the dropdown list to select users (the users are already inserted in the database by default). 

	1. Select a User.
	2. The subscription for the selected user is displayed on the screen.
	3. Now, any record that is being inserted in the "Activities" collection is displayed as notification to the user.
